  <h2>About Motions of the Heart</h2>
  <p>
    Motions of the Heart was created to help people say what’s on their heart
    when the words are hard to find. I write custom poems and song lyrics that
    are built around your stories, your memories, and the people you love.
  </p>

  <h3>What I Create</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Personalized poems for anniversaries, birthdays, weddings, and more</li>
    <li>Comforting memorial and sympathy pieces</li>
    <li>Romantic, funny, or faith-based poems and lyrics</li>
    <li>Framed keepsakes with burned edges for a vintage, storybook look</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>About Lori E.</h3>
  <p>
    I’m Lori Adkins Etenburn, but many people simply call me “Lori E.”
    I’ve been writing from the heart for years—poems, songs, and words
    that speak to real life. My greatest joy is taking a few details from you
    and turning them into something meaningful you can keep forever.
  </p>

  <h3>What Makes This Different?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Each piece is written from scratch just for you—no templates.</li>
    <li>I include names, dates, memories, and inside jokes you share.</li>
    <li>You get a preview before it is finalized, with one round of edits included.</li>
    <li>You can choose digital delivery or a framed, ready-to-gift piece.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you’re ready to create something special for someone you love,
    you can start an order in just a few minutes.
