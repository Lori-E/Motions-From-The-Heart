<h4>Resulting Poem</h4>
<p><em>
As the time goes near,<br>
All the questions will start.<br>
A new life is created<br>
With a single beat of a heart.<br><br>

A beautiful baby,<br>
A joy to your eyes.<br>
The question of what it will be<br>
No longer a surprise.<br><br>

It may have Daddy’s lips,<br>
It may have Mommy's hair.<br>
But it's all up to you<br>
To teach them what is right and what is fair.<br><br>

It won't always be easy,<br>
But it will be worth every mile,<br>
When those first words come out<br>
Through their little happy smile.<br><br>

When the curiosity stage arises<br>
With that spark in their eyes,<br>
Enjoy their innocence in life—<br>
For the time truly flies.<br><br>

Don’t forget to enjoy each other<br>
With the new life you helped create.<br>
Take one day at a time;<br>
Leave the leaping to fate.<br><br>

Being great parents isn't easy,<br>
But it will pay off in the end,<br>
When your child can look at you<br>
Not only as a parent—but also as a friend.
