  <h2>Sample Styles</h2>
  <p>These short samples show the tone and style of some of my writing. Your piece will be created from your own details and story.</p>

  <h3>Anniversary – Romantic & Heartfelt</h3>
  <p><em>
    We started with two nervous smiles<br>
    and a borrowed Friday night,<br>
    now every ordinary morning<br>
    feels like something done just right.
  </em></p>

  <h3>Birthday – Fun & Playful</h3>
  <p><em>
    Another year of jokes and grace,<br>
    of coffee spills and warm embrace.<br>
    If life’s a cake, you’re the sweet part,<br>
    the frosting wrapped around my heart.
  </em></p>

  <h3>Memorial – Gentle & Comforting</h3>
  <p><em>
    Your chair sits quiet by the door,<br>
    but love still walks across this floor.<br>
    In every laugh and every song,<br>
    a piece of you still lives along.
  </em></p>

  <p>
    When you place an order, your piece will be written just for you—
    names, dates, faith, humor, and personal memories can all be included.
